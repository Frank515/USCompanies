Data Objectives of Veteran status in business firm census
1.	The primary objective of my data research is to define the status of business ownership among veterans.  The US census data from 2012 in the minority subset gives a reasonable picture of the number and percentage of US veterans who are owners or part-owners of firms in the US using the NAICS definitions.  My primary questions are the following:
  a.	Are veterans as likely to be sole or partial owners of businesses in comparison to non-veterans in the 18 to 65 y/o age group (both males and females as well as males alone)?
  b.	What businesses (NAICS definitions) are veterans most likely to be owners or partial owners of?
  c.	What percentage of veterans have paid employees and what are the average wages paid to those employees of veteran-owned companies?
  d.	What is the gross receipts of veteran-owned firms(per capita)  in comparison to the non-veteran-owned firms?  Is there a specific business in which veterans have a higher per capita income stream than non-veterans?
2.	The secondary objectives of my research is to calculate similar contributions of the minority labor force to American businesses.  The Hispanic population subset is chosen because they are the second most populous group in the US next to whites in the 2012 census.
