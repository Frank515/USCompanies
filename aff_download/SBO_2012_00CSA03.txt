Statistics for All U.S. Firms by Industry, Veteran Status, and Ethnicity for the U.S., States, Metro Areas, Counties, and Places: 2012

Release Date : 12/15/2015

[NOTE: Includes firms with paid employees and firms with no paid employees. Data are based on the 2012 Economic Census, and the estimates of business ownership by gender, ethnicity, race, and veteran status are from the 2012 Survey of Business Owners. Detail may not add to total due to rounding or because a Hispanic firm may be of any race. Moreover, each owner had the option of selecting more than one race and therefore is included in each race selected. Firms with more than one domestic establishment are counted in each geographic area and industry in which they operate, but only once in the U.S. and state totals for all sectors. For information on confidentiality protection, sampling error, nonsampling error, and definitions, see Survey Methodology.]
